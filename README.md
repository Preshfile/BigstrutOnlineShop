<h1>BigstrutOnlineShop<h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the BigstrutOnlineShop repository! This project is a shopping cart application developed by Precious Oranye for a short specialization portfolio project. The goal of this project is to create a seamless and delightful e-commerce journey for users, allowing them to browse products, view detailed product information, add products to their carts, and securely process payments using PayPal.</p>
<h2>Project Objective</h2>
<p>The main objective of BigstrutOnlineShop is to provide users with a smooth and convenient shopping experience. Key features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Browse Products:</b> Users can access detailed information about various products available in the online store.</li>
<li><b>Product Details:</b> When a user selects a specific product, the application presents only relevant and detailed information about that item.</li>
<li><b>Shopping Cart Functionality:</b> Users can effortlessly add their desired products to their shopping cart by clicking on a dedicated button.</li>
<li><b>Secure Payment Processing:</b> For a smooth and safe payment process, PayPal is integrated as the payment gateway, allowing users to make payments using credit cards or PayPal accounts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technology Stack</h2>
<p>This project was carefully developed using a modern and efficient technology stack to ensure the best possible user experience, scalability, and ease of development. The chosen technologies are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Blazor WebAssembly:</b> The client-side technology, which allows for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces using C# and Razor syntax. By running the entire application directly in the user's browser, Blazor delivers a responsive and fast experience, providing a traditional desktop application feel without constant server round-trips for rendering.</li>
<li><b>ASP.NET Core Web API:</b> The server-side technology, providing a robust and scalable framework for building RESTful APIs. This integration with Blazor WebAssembly ensures smooth communication between the client and server. ASP.NET Core's high performance and cross-platform capabilities handle critical business logic, data processing, and database interactions.</li>
<li><b>Entity Framework Core:</b> This Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool simplifies database access and management, allowing interaction with database entities using C# classes and LINQ queries. The abstraction of low-level database interactions accelerates development and eases maintenance.</li>
<li><b>PayPal Payment Gateway:</b> To ensure secure payment processing, PayPal is integrated into the shopping cart application. With PayPal's reputation as a trusted payment solution, customers can make payments confidently using various methods, such as credit cards or PayPal accounts.</li>
<li><b>C# Programming Language:</b> C# is used on both the client (Blazor WebAssembly) and server-side (ASP.NET Core), providing a consistent development experience and code reuse. Its power as a statically-typed language ensures strong type safety, leading to stable and maintainable code. The large C# developer community and extensive tooling support make it an ideal choice for building complex applications like this shopping cart.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>During the development of BigstrutOnlineShop, one major challenge was the limited timeframe. However, the project was successfully completed, and most of the desired functionalities, including browsing products, viewing product details, adding products to carts, and secure payment processing, were implemented within the given time constraints. </p>
<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
<p>One major functionality that was not implemented in this version of the project was user login using Microsoft Identity. While the project currently allows users to shop as guests, adding user accounts and authentication with Microsoft Identity is a significant enhancement planned for the future. Implementing user accounts will provide a personalized experience for users, enabling features like order history, saved carts, and more. Additionally, further enhancements may include additional payment gateways, improved product recommendations, and responsive design for various devices to accommodate a broader user base. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Thank you for exploring the BigstrutOnlineShop project. With a focus on delivering a smooth and delightful e-commerce journey, this application aims to offer users a seamless shopping experience for IT gadgets. The chosen technology stack ensures a responsive and scalable platform, allowing for potential future enhancements. Your feedback and contributions to this repository are highly appreciated, and we hope you find this shopping cart application intriguing and useful. Happy shopping!</p>
